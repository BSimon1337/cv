    <p>My name is Beau Simon, and I am currently an educator that works for the Grand Forks Public Schools system. Prior
        to working in Grand Forks, I was an educator in Walhalla, ND as a
        Social Studies teacher. During my first two years of teaching, I completed my Master's degree in an online
        setting where I also wrote a masters thesis. For my thesis I researched, developed, and carried out a
        professional experiment that focused on student motivation and self-regulation. To complete this study I
        received IRB approval and wrote about my findings. After completing my research I was able to apply new methods
        and strategizes that enhanced my teaching ability.

        Personally, I have always had a passion for computers and everything tech. I built my first computer when I was
        in high school with little to no experience building computers prior to that. Since then I have done an
        obsessive amount of research into what it takes to work in the computer industry. Most of the hobbies that I
        partake involve some sort of technology or computer. I have dabbled in 3D printing as well which has really
        tested my problem solving abilities even more than building computers has.</p>
